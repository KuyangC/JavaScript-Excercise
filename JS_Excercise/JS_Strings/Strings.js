/*
JS Strings

A JS string is zero or more characters written inside quotes
example:
{
    let text = "Beni":
}
*/

/*
String LLength

To find the length of a string, use the built-in "length" property:
example:
{
    let text = "Bintang Harikahono";
    let length = text.length;
}
*/

/*
Escape Character

Because strings must be written within quotes, JS wll misunderstand this string:
Example:
{
    let text = "Satrio" Andhar "Benny";
}

The solution to avoid this problem, is to use the "\"
The backslash "\" turn special characters into string characters:
Code	Result	Description
\'	    '	    Single quote
\"	    "	    Double quote
\\	    \	    Backslash

/*
JS Strings as Objects

JS Strings are primitive values, created from literals:
{
    let x = "John";
}
